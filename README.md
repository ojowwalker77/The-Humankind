# The-Humankind
A personal project to eventually simulate real human behavior

### "The Humankind 3.1" - A Brief Overview

"The Humankind 3.1" served as a foundational stepping stone towards the ambitious goals set for version 4. It focused on laying the groundwork for a more complex simulation by experimenting with basic genetic traits, individual human definitions, and a simplistic representation of an ecosystem. The primary objective was to explore the potential of Python programming and data modeling in simulating evolutionary and ecological dynamics.

#### Key Features of 3.1:
- **Basic Genetic Traits:** Introduced simple genetic traits like vision, speed, and memory, each providing specific advantages for survival, such as improved food detection and predator avoidance.
- **Individual Human Attributes:** Defined basic attributes for simulated humans, including vision range, movement speed, HP (health points), and the capacity to inherit and pass on genes.
- **Simplified Map and Ecosystem:** Utilized a 200x200 grid as a basic map to simulate random spawning of food sources (fruits and animals), humans, and predators, setting the stage for interaction and survival challenges.

"The Humankind 3.1" was primarily an experimental version to test learning algorithms and practice Python skills, focusing on the rudimentary aspects of life simulation.
